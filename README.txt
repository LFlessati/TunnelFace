The files in this release are the implementation of the approaches proposed in [1] and in [2] for unreinforced and reinforced (with fibreglass pipes) tunnel faces, respectively.
The release is available both for excel and as Phyton

The approach in [1] allows to calculate the average face extrusion in case of unreinforced deep tunnel faces under undrained condtions. From a practical point of view this value can be used to decide whether tunnel face requires support or not. 
In addition, average face extrusion can be used to preliminary estimate spoil and volume loss at the tunnel face (work currently under review).

The approach in [1] allows to calculate the average face extrusion in case of reinforced deep tunnel faces under undrained condtions. From a practical point of view this value can be used to decide whether the number/length of the reinforcement is sufficient to reach a given target face displacement. Constraints of face displacements can come from a maximum admissible volume loss.
